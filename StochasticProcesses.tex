Chapman-Kolmogorov equations
The Chapman–Kolmogorov equation is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process
 
\subsection*{Renewal Theory}
 
Renewal theory is the branch of probability theory that generalizes Poisson processes for arbitrary holding times. Applications include calculating the expected time for a monkey who is randomly tapping at a keyboard to type the word Macbeth and comparing the long-term benefits of different insurance policies.
 
 
Probability Generating Function
    PGF of a binomial RV
 
    Abel's Theorem
        Abel's theorem for power series relates a limit of a power series to the sum of its coefficients.
